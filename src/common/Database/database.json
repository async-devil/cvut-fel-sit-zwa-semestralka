To a large bowl, add flour, salt, and sugar; mix that until incorporated.<\/li><li>Add your water with yeast to your flour and mix by hand until you get a relatively smooth dough, about 4 min. Next, shape your dough into a ball, generously grease a large bowl with olive oil, and place your dough; cover with greased plastic wrap and rise in the fridge overnight.<\/li><li>Punch down your dough, place it onto a lightly floured work surface, divide it into 300 grams pieces, roll each piece into a light ball, and put it into a lightly floured proofing box or a baking sheet (leaving room in between each other). Cover with a lid or greased plastic wrap and let it proof for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature or until doubled in size.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Sauce & Assembly:<\/h3><ul><li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to max temperature for one hour before baking, or set up your pizza oven to 650F.<\/li><li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add olive oil, garlic, butter, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic turns into a light golden brown.<\/li><li>Then add pepper flakes and saute for 20 seconds, followed by tomatoes, sugar, oregano, and thyme. Stir together, season with salt, add onion, bring it to a simmer, and cook that down, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.<\/li><li>Remove the onion, adjust the salt levels and cool down completely.<\/li><li>Assembly.- Place one of your dough rounds on a lightly floured work surface and generously flour your dough. Next, begin punching out a very thin perimeter in the dough, trip the dough over your fists, and shimmer around the entire perimeter of the dough, lightly stretching it as you go until you get a pizza round, about 2 -3 inches wide.<\/li><li>Lay it back down, place a couple of tablespoons of your sauce in the center, and spread it around in a circular motion, leaving a slight edge.<\/li><li>Top with a generous amount of freshly grated mozzarella and place in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes or in a pizza oven for 2 to 4 minutes. Repeat with the rest of your dough.<\/li><\/ul>"
